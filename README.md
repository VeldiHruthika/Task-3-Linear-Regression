Task-3: Linear Regression

About this Task:
Hey! This is my third task where I implemented both simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing price dataset — to understand how predictions work using one feature and also with multiple features.

-I used the Housing dataset for this task.

What I did in this task:
1.Imported the dataset using Pandas.

2.Checked the data — like column names and missing values.

3.Selected area as input (independent feature) and price as output (target) for simple linear regression.

4.Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

5.Trained a Simple Linear Regression model using sklearn.

6.Predicted the price values on the test data.

7.Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score — to check how well it worked.

8.Plotted the regression line — showing actual vs predicted values.

9.Printed the model’s intercept and slope — to see how area affects the price.


Then I did Multiple Linear Regression:

i.Selected area, bedrooms, and bathrooms as input features.

ii.Trained a second model using those 3 features.

iii.Evaluated the multiple regression model with the same metrics.

iv.Printed all the coefficients — to understand how each feature impacts the price.

v.Didn’t plot this one since multiple features can’t be shown on one 2D graph.
